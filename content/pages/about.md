I'm writing software since I am 15 years old.
Having started with Visual Basic and later learning Delphi, C++, Perl, I'm using Java, JavaScript and Python on a professional level.
I'm passionate about good software design and clean code.

### By night

In my spare time, I like to contribute to Open Source Projects and learn new things.
Through the [RaspberryPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), I came to [Python](https://www.python.org/). Man, I love this language and the community.


For the community, I like to attend Python conferences like [PyConDE](https://de.pycon.org/) and [EuroPython]({filename}/development/europython2019.md).
I try to give something back by volunteering and giving talks:
